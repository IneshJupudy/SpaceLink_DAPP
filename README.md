Decentralized issues trying to be addressed:
One of the biggest issues right now in the space Industry is global collaboration because there are so many geopolitical factors restricting collaboration for the space industry. Some of the other current decentralized issues I am trying to address are existing methods of storing, retrieving, organizing, observing space assets are complex. They are often over secured and over privatized.  There is a certain lack of transparency. There are always security issues with the current centralized model due to the vulnerability at the user end being hacked. With this blockchain model, these risks can be completely overruled. This model promises long-term reliability from manufacturing to transactions to security over the current model along with an agenda of 'Internet for All.'


USE CASE :

A decentralised blockchain - based network of Space Objects from Satellites to manned Space ships.
Issues with existing centralised model:

Existing methods for space assets are complex.
Restricted monitoring of space assets by limited powerhouses.
Risk of tampering with space assets.
Lack of supreme monitoring of all space assets with one organization.
Lack of potential to automate, decentralize and democratize operations.








Proposed Blockchain based solution:

Organizations can keep their private/ top space assets as per their usual routine.
Along with that they can participate as members in a decentralised consortium using a blockchain platform(Ethereum).
This solution addresses issues above by  keeping other non private assets of all space organizations verified and validated and by conditions using smart contract functions on the blockchain.
Smooth transparency and decentralization is achieved of space assets.
All transactions/ resources recorded on blockchain for security and validation.
Benefits:

Simplified solutions of space tasks for all space assets.
Better reliable transparency.
Efficient use of resources.
Opportunities for collaboration among space organizations benefiting the general public and development.
Better management of emergencies.
Innovative, clean , secure model for Space Industry .
